<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pleural Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transudative Pleural Effusions</li><li>Exudative Pleural Effusions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pleural drainage system market can be categorized based on the type of pleural effusions: transudative and exudative. Transudative pleural effusions arise from systemic conditions that cause fluid imbalance, often resulting from heart failure or cirrhosis. In contrast, exudative pleural effusions are caused by localized factors such as infections, malignancies, or inflammatory diseases, leading to protein-rich fluid accumulation. The differentiation between these types influences treatment protocols, driving demand for specific drainage systems tailored to their management.</p></p>
