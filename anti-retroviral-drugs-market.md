<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Retroviral Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Protease Inhibitors</li><li>Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</li><li>Integrase Inhibitors</li><li>Nucleoside Analogs and Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-retroviral drugs market comprises various classes, each targeting HIV differently. Protease inhibitors block viral replication by inhibiting the protease enzyme, while non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors bind to reverse transcriptase, preventing viral RNA conversion to DNA. Integrase inhibitors disrupt the integration of viral DNA into the host genome. Nucleoside analogs mimic natural nucleosides, interrupting viral replication, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, hindering the virus's ability to multiply. Together, these classes form a comprehensive treatment landscape for HIV.</p></p>
