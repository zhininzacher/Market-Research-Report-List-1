<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis Dialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialysis machines market is primarily divided into two types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves filtering blood through an artificial kidney, or dialyzer, outside the body, typically performed in clinics or at home. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis uses the body's peritoneal cavity to filter waste, allowing for greater flexibility and independence for patients, often conducted at home. Both methods cater to patients with chronic kidney disease, offering tailored solutions based on individual health needs and preferences.</p></p>
