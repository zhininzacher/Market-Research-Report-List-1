<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Mold Releases</li><li>External Mold Releases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The release agent market is divided into two main types: internal mold releases and external mold releases. Internal mold releases are incorporated into the material being molded, providing a built-in barrier that facilitates easy removal. Conversely, external mold releases are applied directly onto the mold's surface before the molding process, creating a separation layer between the mold and the finished product. Both types aim to reduce friction, prevent sticking, and enhance the quality of molded parts in various manufacturing applications.</p></p>
